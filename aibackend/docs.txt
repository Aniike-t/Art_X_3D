                *   **Color:**  Click the color swatch to select the light's color using the color picker.
                *   **Intensity:**  Adjust the brightness of the light using the number input or slider.  Higher values create brighter light.
                *   **Position:**  Control the light's location in the 3D scene using the X, Y, and Z input fields.
            *   **Spot Light Specific Properties:**
                *   **Angle:** Controls the width of the light's cone.  Enter a value in radians (or use the slider).  Smaller angles create a narrower beam.
                *   **Penumbra:** Controls the softness of the edges of the spotlight's cone.  A value of 0 creates a sharp edge, while a value of 1 creates a very soft, gradual falloff.
                * **Distance:** How far the light can travel.
                * **Decay:** How the light gets dimmer as it travels, similar to how light behaves in the real world.
                *   **Target:**  Determines the point in 3D space that the spotlight is pointing at.  You can adjust the target's X, Y, and Z coordinates.
            *  **Directional Light Specific Properties:**
                *   **Target:** Determines the point in the 3D that the directional light is pointing *towards*. Similar to a spot light.

        **Light Helpers:**

        *   When a light is selected, a visual helper is displayed in the Viewport to aid in positioning and aiming the light:
            *   **Point Light Helper:** A small sphere indicates the light's position.
            *   **Spot Light Helper:**  A wireframe cone shows the light's direction, angle, and range.
            *   **Directional Light Helper:**  A set of lines and a target object indicate the light's direction and the direction it's facing.
        *   These helpers are only visible when the light is selected and are *not* rendered in the final scene. They are purely for editing purposes.

3.4. Viewport Interaction
